# Development of the Media Social Media Platform Using JDBC and MySQL

The **media** project is a social media platform concept developed with the objective of allowing users to share posts, connect with friends, and engage in real-time interactions. The platform integrates essential features of popular social media applications, including user registration, posting content, messaging, and following other users. The database is structured with MySQL, and Javaâ€™s JDBC framework is used to manage database operations, ensuring efficient and reliable data access.

## Objectives
1. **Create a social media platform** with the following core features:
   - User registration and authentication
   - Content sharing (text and images)
   - Direct messaging between users
   - Liking and commenting on posts
   - Following and interacting with other users

2. **Establish a secure and stable JDBC connection** to enable smooth interactions between the platform's frontend and the MySQL database backend.

3. **Ensure data consistency and integrity** across multiple users with a robust database schema.
